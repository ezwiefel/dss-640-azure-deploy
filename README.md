# Deploy Oracle and Hortonworks Sandbox to Azure
This is the deploy script for DSS 640 class virtual machines. _Remember that the VMs turn off every night at 2 AM. You may need to start them in the Azure Portal before you can do work on them._ 

## Recent Changes and Notes: 
* You will see only one textbox each for username and password. This will be the globally used username and password. 
* Fixes issues around password complexity.
